A curated set of compact case studies demonstrating how first-principles physics concepts translate to quantitative finance.

Each study is self-contained within its own subfolder.

## How to Use This Directory

Every subfolder represents one standalone case study and contains two primary artifacts:

1.  **`analysis.ipynb`**: The full, reproducible Jupyter Notebook with all methods, data, and diagnostics for a deep technical review.
2.  **`[lastname]_[firstname]_[project_name]_memo.pdf`**: A concise executive memo summarizing the key findings and the "Quant Takeaway," intended for recruiters and hiring managers.
