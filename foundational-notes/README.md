# Jesús Garví - Quantitative Finance Portfolio

A curated portfolio of projects demonstrating a first-principles, quantitative approach to financial markets. Each project is a standalone case study with a full analysis and a concise executive summary.

## 1. Dual Momentum Backtesting Engine
A complete, command-line-driven backtesting engine for a systematic dual momentum strategy. It includes data fetching, signal generation, portfolio construction with cost modeling, and performance analytics.

*   **Concepts:** Relative & Absolute Momentum, Time Series Analysis, Backtesting, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown.

## 2. Modeling Signal Decay: A Mean-Reversion Strategy
This project models the decay of a mean-reverting signal using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, first validated on a physical system (Newton's Cooling) and then applied to a real-world ETF pair spread. The core output is the signal's half-life, a key parameter for statistical arbitrage.

*   **Concepts:** Mean Reversion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, AR(1), Half-Life, Statistical Arbitrage, Cointegration.

## 3. Quantifying Market Regimes & Tail Risk
An empirical study of scaling laws in time series to diagnose market behavior. The Hurst exponent is used to measure persistence (trending vs. mean-reverting), and the tail exponent is used to quantify extreme risk (fat tails).

*   **Concepts:** Scaling Laws, Power Laws, Hurst Exponent, Tail Risk (Alpha), Fractal Dimension.

## 4. Foundations of Monte Carlo Simulation
A prototype for a high-entropy random seed generator based on information theory. This project explores the theoretical foundations of randomness required for robust Monte Carlo methods in derivatives pricing and risk modeling.

*   **Concepts:** Shannon Entropy, Information Theory, Randomness Extraction, Rejection Sampling, Monte Carlo.
